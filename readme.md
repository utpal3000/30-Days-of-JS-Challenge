## Day 1 : Variables and Data Types âœ…

1. Value of the `const` variable must be given during its initilization itself.
2. You can't reassign any value to a const var.
3. You can't redeclare any variable
4. Don't use `var` use only `let` and `const` to declare any variables

## Day 2 : Operators

1. You can easily perform all basic arthematic operations in JS
2. Comparison check is not strict check
3. Strict check `===` checks the value of the var as well as the `typeof`.
4. Use ternary operator `?:;` for only simple if statements like a check for something.

## Day 3 : Control Structures

1. Nested if-else, don't use else-if.
2. Switch case uses strict comparisons, you can NOT use directly support range comparisons. Hence, trick is to use true in swtich expression

```js
let x = 20;
let value;

switch (true){
    case x>10 :
        value='Less';
        break;
    case x>100 :
        value='More';
        break;
    default:
        value='zero';
}
```

Use and operator `&&` and `||` or operator together instead of if-else-if :)

## Day 4 : Loops

1. How to use different loops.
2. In loop outer loop runs for the no. of rows u want the pattern to print where as inner loop is for the col.
3. `continue` and `break` are used to control the flow of for/ while loops.
