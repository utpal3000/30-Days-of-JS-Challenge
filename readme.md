## Day 1 : Variables and Data Types âœ…

1. Value of the `const` variable must be given during its initilization itself.
2. You can't reassign any value to a const var.
3. You can't redeclare any variable
4. Don't use `var` use only `let` and `const` to declare any variables

## Day 2 : Operators

1. You can easily perform all basic arthematic operations in JS
2. Comparison check is not strict check
3. Strict check `===` checks the value of the var as well as the `typeof`.
4. Use ternary operator `?:;` for only simple if statements like a check for something.

## Day 3 : Control Structures

1. Nested if-else, don't use else-if.
2. Switch case uses strict comparisons, you can NOT use directly support range comparisons. Hence, trick is to use true in swtich expression

```js
let x = 20;
let value;

switch (true){
    case x>10 :
        value='Less';
        break;
    case x>100 :
        value='More';
        break;
    default:
        value='zero';
}
```

Use and operator `&&` and `||` or operator together instead of if-else-if :)

## Day 4 : Loops

1. How to use different loops.
2. In loop outer loop runs for the no. of rows u want the pattern to print where as inner loop is for the col.
3. `continue` and `break` are used to control the flow of for/ while loops.

## Day 5 : Functions


1. `return` is optional in a `function`.
2. Normal function declarations are *hoisted*, while function expressions are not.
3. Arrow functions are best suited for non-method functions (functions not attached to objects) and should not be used as constructors.
4. Arrow functions have their own limitations, such as not having access to the arguments object.
5. A higher-order function (HOF) is a concept in programming where a function accepts another function as an argument and returns a function as its result. In other words, it treats other functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be used just like other data types (such as strings or numbers) in your code
