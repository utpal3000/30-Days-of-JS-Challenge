# Day 6 : Arrays

**Tasks/Activities:**

## Activity 1: Array Creation and Access

1. Create an array of numbers from 1 to 5 and log the array to the console.

2. Access the first and last elements of the array and log them to the console.

## Activity 2: Array Methods (Basic)

3. Use the push method to add a new number to the end of the array and log the updated array.
4. Use the pop method to remove the last element from the array and log the updated array.
5. Use the shift method to remove the first element from the array and log the updated array.
6. Use the unshift method to add a new number to the beginning of the array and log the updated array.

## Activity 3: Array Methods (Intermediate)

7. Use the map method to create a new array where each number is doubled and log the new array.
8. Use the filter method to create a new array with only even numbers and log the new array.
9. Use the reduce method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array and log the result.

## Activity 4: Array Iteration

10. Use a for loop to iterate over the array and log each element to the console.
11. Use the forEach method to iterate over the array and log each element to the console.

## Activity 5: Multi-dimensional Arrays

12. Create a two-dimensional array (matrix) and log the entire array to the console.
13. Access and log a specific element from the two-dimensional array.

## Feature Request

1. Array Manipulation Script: Write a script that demonstrates the creation of an array, adding and removing elements using
push, pop, shift, and unshift methods.
2. Array Transformation Script: Create a script that uses map, filter, and reduce methods to transform and aggregate
array data.
3. Array Iteration Script: Write a script that iterates over an array using both for loop and foreach method and logs each
element.
4. Two-dimensional Array Script: Create a script that demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a two-dimensional array.

## Achievement

*By the end of these activities, students will:*
‚Ä¢ Create and manipulate arrays using various methods.
‚Ä¢ Transform and aggregate array data using map, filter, and reduce.
‚Ä¢ Iterate over arrays using loops and iteration methods.
‚Ä¢ Understand and work with multi-dimensional arrays.

## My Learnings üçÉ

1. Arrays in JS can store any data types.

    ```js
    let myArray = ['mango','banana',true,100]
    ```

2. Javascript doesn't support negative      indexing. 
Use `length` to check the no. of elements an array has.

3. `push` and `pop` works from the end of array, where as `shift` and `unshift` works from start of array.
4. `shift/unshift` affects the indexing of all the elements in the array.
5. `Push` allows you to push more than one elements at once.

6. `map()`, `reduce()`, `filter()` all are higher order funtions and they take a callback function (CB Funtn )as a parameter.
7. `Reduce()` it take a CB funtn and initial value, [ref. MDN reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)]

8. Use `ForEach` to iterate over an array.
9. 2D array, array inside an array :)
10. 2D array manually or other way like `from()`
