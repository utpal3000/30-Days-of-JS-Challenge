# Day 7 : Objects

**Tasks/Activities:**

### Activity 1: Object Creation and Access

• Task 1: Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and year, and log the object to the console.
• Task 2: Access and log the title and author properties of the book object.

### Activity 2: Object Methods

• Task 3: Add a method to the book object that returns a string with the book's title and author, and log the result of calling this
method.
• Task 4: Add a method to the book object that takes a parameter (year) and updates the book's year property, then log the
updated object.

### Activity 3: Nested Objects

• Task 5: Create a nested object representing a library with properties like name and books (an array of book objects), and log
the library object to the console.
• Task 6: Access and log the name of the library and the titles of all the books in the library.

### Activity 4: The this Keyword

• Task 7: Add a method to the book object that uses the this keyword to return a string with the book's title and year, and log
the result of calling this method.
Activity 5: Object Iteration
• Task 8: Use a for... in loop to iterate over the properties of the book object and log each property and its value.
• Task 9: Use Object. keys and Object. values methods to log all the keys and values of the book object.

## Feature Request

1. Book Object Script: Write a script that creates a book object, adds methods to it, and logs its properties and method results.
2. Library Object Script: Create a script that defines a library object containing an array of book objects and logs the library's
details.
3. Object Iteration Script: Write a script that demonstrates iterating over an object's properties using for... in loop and
object. keys / object.values.

## Achivement

By the end of these activities, students will:
• Create and manipulate objects with properties and methods.
• Understand and use the this keyword in object methods.
• Work with nested objects and arrays of objects.
• Iterate over an object's properties using loops and built-in methods.

## My Learnings

1. Ojects in JS

    ```js
    const myObject = {name:'utpal',age:'22',location:'Pune',role:'Dev'}
    ```

2. `ForEach` iterates over the array elements and executes a provided function for each item. However, it doesn’t return any value or anything.

3. `map()` method in JavaScript is used with arrays. It creates a new array by applying a provided function to each element in the original array.

4. Arrow function don't have their `this` context.
